Intermediate Java - Highschool Course

This is the second repo (out of 3) that is used to save my old highschool Java class exercises. 
Intermediate Java was a continuation of Introduction to Java. Both of these classes (electives) were 
required prerequesites for AP Computer Science. I took these classes my Junior year.
